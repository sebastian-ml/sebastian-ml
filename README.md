### Hello, I am Sebastian ðŸ‘‹
<hr></hr>

#### Skills
<p>Technologies that I am familiar with are <b>Python, Django, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, VBA.</b></p>
 <p>I am not an expert, I'm still learning and constantly improving my skills by making personal projects which are still developed. Some of them can be found in my github repo.</p>
<p>Things like Python, SQL/databases, VBA I've learned at the university. JavaScript, HTML, CSS I've been learning for several months during online courses and making personal projects.</p>
<p>... and still learning, because there is so much knowledge to gain</p>

#### Studying, working, learning
<p>I'm graduating full-time master's studies in the field of data analytics at the SGH Warsaw School of Economics this autumn. I'm also working as a B2B Analyst and in my spare time I'm learning programming. Because of that, I'm a bit busy person but I think I've also learned how to be flexible and how to manage my time.</p>

#### Future programming plans
<ul>
  <li>Improve skills that I am familiar with</li>
  <li>Learn new things e.g. React</li>
  <li>Get a new job that will help me boost my skills quicker</li>
 </ul>
